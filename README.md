An RNN based model which is used to generate color from text.

## Some Guidelines for the Project:- 

- Ensure to write well structured and readable code. 

## Models:-

- [X] Make a simple Model (**colgen-1**) 
- Make it based on character level tokenization
- [ ] Model with word-embedding (**colgen-2**) 
- Make it based on word level tokenization
- don't use precalculated word embeddings



## Web UI

- [X] Basic UI
- [X] Generate Color Functionality
- [ ] Save old color which are liked
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Add API endpoints
- [ ] Add API Documentation
- [ ] Add option to select which model to use
